**** Ansible Installation ****
1) yum install ansible -y
2) ssh connection -> add user on on both the servers ex: control & Target machines
3) useradd ansible/passwd ansible
4) Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on the control machine and uncomment 
   out the lines for PasswordAuthentication and PermitRootLogin
5) systemctl restart sshd
6) To enable passwordless authentication to perform the steps shown below. 
   Firstly add the user ansible to the /etc/sudoers file on both the 
   machines which will enable the user ansible to run any command which 
   requires root privileges
7) create ssh key on both the machines using ssh-keygen
8) copy ssh key from control machine to target machine using ssh-copy-id ip-172-31-7-193 
9) Now password less connection between two servers using ssh ip-172-31-7-193
 

error: You may try edit in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       PasswordAuthentication yes
       service sshd restart (in both source and destination machines)
       
   -   generate ssh-keygen -> edit & copy id_rsa.pub to target machine 
   -   create .ssh/authorized_keys on target machine.
   -   target machine: chmod 700 .ssh/
                       chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys

5) usermod -G admin one
6) edit sshd {# vi /etc/ssh/sshd [PasswordAuthentication yes]}
7) repeat step:1 to step:6 on slave machine
8) login to user one on master
9) install ansible {1) sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel, 2) sudo yum insyall ansible -y}
10) edit inventory file {# vi /etc/ansible/hosts [ex: 10.0.1.50]}

--------------------------------------

Adhoc commands
----------------
- ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free' (inventory, module, argument) 
- ansible all -m user -a 'name=one passsword=one' -b (become, for higher privileges on managed nodes)
  (we got error: permission denied)
- ansible all -m command -a 'touch file1' (create file)
- ansible all -m yum -a 'name=git state=present' -b
- ansible all -m yum -a 'name=httpd state=latest' -b

Notes: Page1
---------------------
2 Ways  ansible can perform configuration.
1) adhoc commands
2) playbooks

adhoc commands
----------------

Important modules in ansible
1) command - This module is used for executing basic linux commands on managed nodes.
2) shell -  This module is used to execute commands which involved redirection and piping and 
                   to execute shell scripts on managed nodes.
3) ping  --  This module is used to check if the remote server is pingable or not.
4) user --  This module is used for user management like create user, setting password, assign home directory  etc
5) copy  --  This module is used to copy the files and folders from controller to managed nodes
6) fetch  --  This module is used to copy files and folder from managed nodes to controller
7) file  --  This module is used for creating or deleting files and folders on managed nodes.
8) stat  --  Used to capture detailed information about files and folders present in managed nodes.
9) debug --  Used to display output of any module
10) apt   --  Used for performing package management on managed nodes ie installing softwares / upgrading repositories  etc . It works on ubuntu, debain flavours of linux. 
11) yum  --  similar to apt module. It works on Red hat linux, centos etc
12) git  --  used to perform git version controlling on managed nodes
13) replace -- This is used to replace specific text in configuration file with some other text.
14) service  -- used for starting / stoping / restarting services on managed nodes.
15) include  --  Used for calling child play books  from parent play book
16) uri    -- useful in checking  if remote url is reachable or not.
17) docker_container  --  used to execute docker  commands related to container management on managed nodes
18) docker_image  --  used to execute commands related to docker images on managed nodes.
19) docker_login  --  used to login to docker hub from managed nodes.
20) setup   --  used to capturing system information related to the managed nodes.

$ ansible all  -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command  -a 'free'


$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'touch file1'


To check the file which is created
$ ssh 172.31.30.144    ( this command will go that machine  )
$  ls  
$  exit    ( to come back to controller )

++++++++++++++++
To install docker in all managed nodes

$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m shell -a 'curl  -fsSL  https://get.docker.com  -o get-docker.sh'   

$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'   




+++++++++++++
To check docker is installed or not

$ ssh 172.31.30.144
$ docker  --version
$  exit  (  to come back to controller )

+++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++
Ansible command module to check the  memory info on all managed nodes
$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free'

++++++++++++++++++
To open the default inventory file

$ sudo vim  /etc/ansible/hosts

( Observation:  3 ip address are available )

+++++++++++++++++
Now, I copy the first two IP address (  in a  new notepad file )
quit the inventory file

+++++++++++++

Create my own inventory file
$ vim  myinventory
go to insert mode

paste two ip address
save and quit

+++++++++++
To check the inventory file

$ cat myinventory

+++++++++++
$ ansible all -i myinventory -m command -a 'free'

Observation:  free command works on only two machines

+++++++++++++
If you do not mention the inventory file, it takes default inventory file.
ex:
$ ansible all  -m command -a 'free'



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
command module is the default module in ansible

$ ansible all  -a 'free'

++++++++++++++++++++++

Note:
The defualt inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts  and when using this inventory file, we need not use -i option.
ex:
$ ansible all  -m command -a 'free'

The default module  is module. When using command module we need not use -m option
ex:
$ ansible all  -a 'free'

Shell Module
----------------
ansible command to execute ls  -la  and store the output into  file1 on all the managed nodes.

$ ansible  all  -m  shell -a 'ls -la > file1'

To check the file which is created

$ ssh 172.31.6.207
$ ls
$ exit   ( to come back to controller )

+++++++++++++++
command to install docker  on all managed nodes

$ ansible all  -m shell -a 'curl  -fsSL  https://get.docker.com  -o get-docker.sh'   

$ ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'   

++++++++++++++++++++++++


User Module:
( From controller )
To create new user

$ sudo  useradd sai

$ vim /etc/passwd     (  User will be created in this file )
To set the password
$ sudo passwd  sai      ( sai is the username)

+++++++++++
Now, i want to create user in all managed nodes

$ ansible  all -m user  -a  'name=anu  password=durgasoft'
( we ger error : permission denied )




$ ansible  all -m user  -a  'name=anu  password=durgasoft'  -b  ( become , for higher privileges on managed nodes )


++++++++++++++
To check if user is create or not

$  ssh 172.31.30.144
$ vim  /etc/passwd
$  exit

+++++++++++++++++++++

Command to create user and set home directory, user id,  default working shell etc
Another example
$ ansible all -m user  -a 'name=Ravi password=freefree uid=1234 comment="A regular user"  home=/home/ubuntu/Ravi shell=/bin/bash' -b

To check for the new user
$  ssh 172.31.6.207
$ vim  /etc/passwd

++++++++++

Page2:
--------------------
Install git in all managed nodes
--------------------------------
$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present'  -b

Observation: 
We get "changed": false
( That means git is already installed on it. The command has no effect in the nodes)

Now , run the below command

$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=absent' -b


( absent  means - uninstall )

output, we get in yellow color 
( scroll up )  we get  "changed":true
( The command is effected the instance )


Now if we run the below command  ( with present option )
$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present' -b

we get  "changed":true	

Notes:
apt module  -- This is used for package management.
1)  ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present' -b


state=present  is for installation
state=latest    for upgradation
state=absent    for uninstallation

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I want to update apt-repositoty and install tomcat8

ansible all -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat8 state=present  update_cache=yes' -b

 
The above command will update apt repository and install tomcat8
To update apt-repository on managed nodes  update_cache=yes  is used 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

File module
--------------
This is used to create files and folder on managed nodes

ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file1  state=touch' 


To check the file which is create
$ ssh 172.31.12.39
$ cd  /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

TO create a directory
ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/dir1  state=directory' 

To check the directory
$ ssh 172.31.12.39
$ cd  /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

To delete the  file
ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file1  state=absent' 


++++++++++++++++++++++++
Notes:
Command to create a file on all managed nodes

ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file1  state=touch' 

state=touch   is to create files
state=directory  is to create directory
state=absent  is for deleting file/directory

++++++++++++++++++++


Copy Module
---------------
This is used for copying the files from controller into managed nodes.

We know in the file  /etc/passwd  we have all the information about users

Now I want to copy the file  into all nodes

$ ansible all -m  copy  -a 'src=/etc/passwd dest=/tmp'



To check the file which is copies

$ ssh 172.31.12.39
$ cd /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

++++++++++++++
Scenario:
I want to create tomcat users file in controller and copy the file in all the nodes

$ sudo vim tomcat-users.xml

Go to Insert mode


<tomcat-users>
   <user  username="training"  password="freefree"  roles="manager-script"/>
<tomcat-users>

:wq

$  ansible all -m  copy  -a  'src=tomcat-users.xml  dest=/etc/tomcat8'  -b



To check the file
--------------------

$ ssh 172.31.12.39
$ cd /etc/tomcat8
$ ls
Open that file to check the contents

$  sudo  cat  tomcat-users.xml

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Create  a  file  on the controller  machine

$ cat  >  newfile1
aaaa
bbbbb
ccccc
ddddd
Ctrl+d

$ ls -l  newfile1
we get the  permissions
rw-rw-r--
When we copy the file  we have the same permissions

$ ansible all -m  copy -a 'src=newfile1  dest=/home/ubuntu'

To got managed node and check the permissions on the file. It remains the same


$ ssh 172.31.12.39
$ ls -l  newfile1
$  exit

Command to copy with changes permissions

$ ansible all -m  copy -a 'src=newfile1  dest=/home/ubuntu owner=root  group=root mode=760' -b

Now, go to node and check the permissions


$ ssh 172.31.11.96
$ ls -l  newfile1
$  exit

Notes:
Copy module is used to change the ownership, group ownership and permissions of the files that are copied to managed nodes.

$ ansible all -m  copy -a 'src=newfile1  dest=/home/ubuntu owner=root  group=root mode=760' -b


++++++++++++++++++++++
Fetch  Module  ( opposite of copy  module )
-----------------------------
Go to managed node

$ ssh 172.31.6.83
$ cd /etc/tomcat8
$ ls

There is server.xml file
I want to  get the file  ( server.xml) from  node to controller

$ exit  ( come back to controller )
$ ansible all  -m fetch  -a 'src=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml  dest=/tmp'  -b

Now  to got tmp folder

$  cd /tmp
$ ls


You will find three folders. The names of the folers are IP address of managed nodes

$ cd 172.31.12.39
$ ls
$ cd etc
$ ls
$ cd tomcat8
$ ls

Notes: 
Fetch module is used to copy files from managed nodes to controller.
Command to copy  tomcat-server.xml  file from all managed nodes into /tmp folder on the controller.

$ ansible all  -m fetch  -a 'src=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml  dest=/tmp'  -b

Git Modules
------------
This is used to perform git related operations on the managed nodes.

ansible all -m  git  -a  'repo=https://github.com/sunildevops77/rep1.git  dest=/tmp/mygit'  -b

The above command will download the files in all managed nodes.

Go to managed node and check
$  ssh 172.31.12.39
$ cd /tmp
$  ls
$ cd mygit
$  ls
$ exit


Notes:
Ansible command to clone remote git repository into all managed nodes
ansible all -m  git  -a  'repo=https://github.com/sunildevops77/rep1.git  dest=/tmp/mygit' -b


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Service Module
---------------------
This is used for starting/ stoping / restarting the services.

Ansible command to restart tomcat8  on all managed nodes
$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=restarted'  -b



state=restarted is for restarting a service
state=stopped  is for stopping a running service
state=started  is for starting a stopped service






Replace module
-----------------
Go to managed node
$ ssh 172.31.6.83
$ cd /etc/tomcat8/
$ ls
$ sudo  vim  server.xml
 
Look for connector  port  , to see the port number in which it is running. ( line 74)

Now, we want to change the port number on all managed nodes, in this scenario
we use replace module.

Quit the server.xml file

$ exit   ( to come back to controller )
$  ansible all  -m replace  -a 'regexp=8080 replace=9090 path=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml'  -b


Lets check tomcat is respoding on 9090 port in managed node

Get public DNS from aws
ec2-13-234-66-138.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Open Browser
URL ---  ec2-13-234-66-138.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:9090

We will not get the page, becuase we need to restart the service 

$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=restarted'  -b

Now, try the above URL  ---  it Works!!

++++++++++++++++

Page3:
----------------
uri  module
-------------------
I want to check URL is reachable for not in all managed nodes.

$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://facebook.com'

In the output  ( green color )  status - 200

Give a invalid url  ,  we get  status as -1


Ex:
$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://hgyi9cb.com'

Now, I want to stop tomcat in all managed nodes  ( Just repeat )
$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=stopped'  -b



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets have an example of all modules
Requirement: I want to install tomcat all modules , then i want to copy  users.xml in all managed nodes, 
I want to change port number of tomcat  , then i want to restart the service, finally i want to check 
url is reachable or not.




1st we need to unintall tomcat in all managed nodes.

$ ansible  all  -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat8 state=absent  purge=yes'  -b

--------------


$  ansible all -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat8 state=present' -b

$  ansible all -m  copy  -a  'src=tomcat-users.xml  dest=/etc/tomcat8'  -b


$ ansible all  -m replace  -a 'regexp=8080 replace=9090 path=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml'  -b 



$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=restarted'  -b



To check tomcat is running individually on all servers,
take the private ip of all nodes
172.31.4.101
172.31.12.39
172.31.6.83


$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.4.101:9090'
It returns status as 200

Similarly  check the other two nodes
$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.12.39:9090'
$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.6.83:9090'

+++++++++++++++++++++
Notes:
Requirement.

 I want to install tomcat all modules.Copy  tomcat-users.xml in all managed nodes.
Change port number of tomcat from 8080 to 9090. Restart the tomcat8 service. 
Finally i want to check url is reachable or not.

$  ansible all -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat8 state=present' -b

$  ansible all -m  copy  -a  'src=tomcat-users.xml  dest=/etc/tomcat8'  -b
$ ansible all  -m replace  -a 'regexp=8080 replace=9090 path=/etc/tomcat8/server.xml'  -b 
$  ansible all   -m service    -a 'name=tomcat8  state=restarted'  -b

To check tomcat is running individually on all servers,
take the private ip of all nodes
172.31.11.96
172.31.6.207
172.31.12.138


$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.11.96:9090  status=200'
It returns status as 200

Similarly  check the other two nodes
$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.6.207:9090  status=200'
$ ansible all -m   uri  -a 'url=http://172.31.12.138:9090  status=200'

+++++++++++++++++++++
Play books
---------------
Notes:
Adhoc commands are capable of working only on one module and one set of arguments.
When we want to perform complex configuration management activities, 
adhoc commands will be difficult to manage.

In such scenarios, we use play books.
Play book is combination of plays.
Each play is designed to do some activity on the managed nodes.
These plays are created to work on single host or a group of hosts or all the hosts.

The main advantage of play books  is reusability.
Play books are created using  yaml files.

Ex 1: Ansible playbook for install git and clone the remote repository


$ mkdir  playbooks
$ cd playbooks
$ vim playbook1.yml
INSERT   mode

---
- name: Install git and clone a remote repository
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install git
      apt:
       name: git
       state: present
       update_cache: yes
    - name: clone remote git repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/sunilkumark11/git-9am-batch.git
        dest: /home/ubuntu/newgit  	
...

To check the syntax:
$ ansible-playbook  playbook1.yml  --syntax-check

( Do not use tab  when creating yml file )

To run the playbook
$ ansible-playbook  playbook1.yml  -b

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2nd example on playbook
---------------------------
Create user on all managed nodes and I want to copy passwd file.

$ vim playbook2.yml

---
- name: Create user and copy passwd file
  hosts: all
  tasks:
          - name: User creation
            user:
             name: kiran
             password: abcde
             uid: 6789
             home: /home/kiran
          - name: Copy password into users home dir
            copy:
             src: /etc/passwd
             dest: /home/kiran
...

Save and quit
$

Check the syntax:
$ ansible-playbook  playbook2.yml  --syntax-check

To run 
$ ansible-playbook  playbook2.yml  -b
 
TO check user is created in managed nodes:
$ ssh  172.31.11.96 
$ vim /etc/passwd

To check  if passwd file is copied to  /home/kiran
$  cd /home/kiran
$ ls
$ exit



Ex 2: Playbook to configure tomcat8   ( earlier  example )



1st uninstall tomcat
$ ansible  all  -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat8 state=absent  purge=yes'  -b

$ vim playbook3.yml

---
- name: Configure  tomcat8
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install tomcat8
     apt:
      name: tomcat8
      state: present
   - name: copy tomcat-users.xml file
     copy:
      src:  /home/ubuntu/tomcat-users.xml
      dest: /etc/tomcat8
   - name: change port of tomcat from 8080 to 9090
     replace:
      regexp: 8080
      replace: 9090
      path: /etc/tomcat8/server.xml
   - name: restart tomcat8
     service:
      name: tomcat8
      state: restarted
   - name: check url response of server 1
     uri:
      url: http://172.31.4.101:9090
   - name:   check url response of server 2
     uri:
      url: http://172.31.12.39:9090
...


$ ansible-playbook  playbook3.yml  --syntax-check
$ ansible-playbook  playbook3.yml  -b

Requirment:
Install apache2  in all managed nodes, Place our own content in default homepage

$ cd playbooks
$ vim playbook4.yml

---
- name: configuring apache2
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install apache2
     apt:
      name: apache2

Save and quit

$ ansible-playbook  playbook4.yml  -b

To check apache2 is installed
$ ssh 172.31.11.96

( Homepage of apache2 is present in /var/www/html )

$ cd  /var/www/html 
$ ls

we get index.html  ( this html file is default homepage of apache )
Editing the index.html page
This is possible using copy module.

$ exit
$ vim playbook4.yml

- name: configuring apache2
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install apache2

How to open url in  terminal?
by using elinks
Ex:
$  elinks http://google.com

We get error ( elinks not found )

Let's install elinks
$ sudo apt-get install -y elinks

Now run the command
$  elinks http://google.com

Now we want to look at index.html file in managed nodes

$ elinks http://172.31.11.96

After editing the index.html file, i need to restart the service and check the url response

$ vim playbook4.yml

---

Page4:
-----------------
Creating reusable playbooks using variables
3 Types of variables
1) Global scope variables   ( highest priority )  - we pass values from command prompt
2) Host scope variables    
3) play scope variables   ( least priority )

Ex of Global scope variables

$ vim playbook5.yml

---
- name: Install software packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install/uninstall/update etc
     apt:
      name: tree
      state: present
      update_cache: yes
...

If we run the above play book 10 times,  what happens?  tree package will install 10 times.
The above play book is not reusable.

we make small changes to the above code

---
- name: Install software packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install/uninstall/update etc
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...


To run the playbook  by passing values to the variables
$ ansible-playbook  playbook5.yml  --extra-vars "a=git b=absent c=no"  -b

( The above command will uninstall git from all nodes )

Run the same playbook with diffrent values
$ ansible-playbook  playbook5.yml  --extra-vars "a=tree b=present c=no"  -b

2nd example of global scope variables
Requirement:  Create users and create file in user's home directory

$ vim playbook6.yml

---
- name: create users and create file in users home dir
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: user creation
     user:
      name: "{{a}}"
      password: "{{b}}"
      home: "{{c}}"
   - name: creating files and dir
     file:
      name: "{{d}}"
      state: "{{e}}"
...

To run the playbook
$ ansible-playbook  playbook6.yml  --extra-vars "a=Mallika b=welcome c=/home/Mallika d=/home/Mallika/file1 e=touch"  -b

Before going to host scope variables,
lets discuss play scope  variables

Playscope variables are definined within the playbook and thet can effect only in one single play.

Ex:

$ vim playbook7.yml

---
- name: Using play scope variable
  hosts: all
  vars:
   - a: tomcat8
   - b: present
   - c: no
  tasks:
   - name: Install tomcat8
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...



$ ansible-playbook  playbook7.yml  -b
( It will install tomcat8 )

We can run by using extra vars from command line
$ ansible-playbook  playbook7.yml  -b  --extra-vars "a=tree b=present c=no"  -b

The above command will install tree because global scope variables have higher priority

Host scope variables
Lets create one more managed node.
So, we will have 1 controller 4 nodes.
In step 6  --  Add rule -- All Traffic -- Anywhere

Check the version in the new node

$ python3 --version

We need to downgrade the machines from python3  to Python2
To downgrade
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ( It will point to  older apt repository  where python2 is available)

$  sudo apt-get install -y python2.7 python-pip

Now check the version of python
$ python --version

Establish password less ssh connection
$ sudo passwd ubuntu
( lets give the password as ubuntu only )

$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

change 
PasswordAuthentication yes
Save and QUIT

$ sudo service ssh restart
$ exit

++++++++++++++++
Now,  Connect to controller
Now , We need to generate ssh connections
$ ssh-keygen

Now copy the key to managed nodes

$ ssh-copy-id ubuntu@172.31.37.62  ( private Ip of server4 )

+++++++++++
Now, we need to add the information of managed nodes in the inventory file.
Location of inventory file   /etc/ansible

$ cd /etc/ansible
$ ls
$ sudo vim hosts
insert the private ip addresss of 4th  server
save and quit

$ ansible all  -a  'ls  -la'    ( you will get the list of the files in all managed nodes )


++++++++++++++++++
We can do grouping using  [groupname]

Ex:

To do grouping

$ sudo vim hosts

[webserver]
172.31.11.96
172.31.6.207
[appserver]
172.31.12.138
[dbserver]
172.31.31.161

+++++++++++++++++++


$ ansible  all

$ ansible appserver  -a 'free'    ( It runs on one machine 172.31.12.138)


$ ansible webserver  -a 'free'   ( It runs on two machines )

+++++++++++++++++++++++

Variable which works on group of hosts

$ cd  ( enter)
$ cd playbooks
$ ls
	
Varibles which work in group of hosts are divided into two types
1) Variables which work in group of machines
2) Variables which work on one machine

 Variables which work in group of machines
------------------------------------------------
playbooks$ mkdir group_vars

Note:  group_vars  folder should be present in the same location of playbook files.

$ cd group_vars
$  vim webserver


a: Prakash
b: logiclabs
c: /home/Prakash
d: 67819
e: /bin/bash

Save and Quit

$ cd ..
playbooks$ vim playbook8.yml

---
- name: Using host scope variables
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
   - name: User creation
     user:
      name: "{{a}}"
      password: "{{b}}"
      home: "{{c}}"
      uid: "{{d}}"
      shell: "{{e}}"
...

save and quit

TO run the playbook
$ ansible-playbook playbook8.yml  -b  ( It runs on two machines)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
*****

Lets add few more variables

$ cd group_vars
$ vim webserver

a: Prakash
b: durgasoft
c: /home/Prakash
d: 67809
e: /bin/bash
f: tree
g: present
h: no

save and quit

$ cd ..
$ vim playbook9.yml

---
- name: Using host scope variables
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
   - name: Install software
     apt:
      name: "{{f}}"
      state: "{{g}}"
      update_cache: "{{h}}"
...

$ ansible-playbook  playbook9.yml  -b

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Variables to work on single hosts

playbooks$ mkdir host_vars
$ cd host_vars
$ vim 172.31.37.62        ( 172.31.37.62   private Ip of server4 )

a: firewalld
b: present
c: yes

save and quit
$ cd ..
$ vim playbook10.yml

---
- name: Use host scope variables
  hosts: 172.31.37.62
  tasks:
   - name: Install firewall
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...

save and quit

$ ansible-playbook  playbook10.yml  -b

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Implementing loops

$ vim playbook11.yml

- name: Install software packages
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
   - name: Install software
     apt:
      name: "{{item}}"
      state: present
      update_cache: no
     with_items:
      - tree
      - git
      - default-jdk
      - apache2
...

$ ansible-playbook  playbook11.yml  -b

Notes: Modules in ansible can be executed multiple times using loops.
 using with_items
