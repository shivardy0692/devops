 -hi this is shiva  and coming to my professional experience i having 5 years of experience as a devops engineer and i working on different 
  areas into the devops configuration side like

project1: Abbott Laboratories (Health Care).
project2: Morgan Stanley (banking).

1) I manage the source code repository administration part using centralized and distributed version control tool.

2) Managing the application build setup for an windows based applicatios and java based applications build through jenkins.
   
3) We use jenkins as a continuous integration server.

4) We use to setup environment on public cloud platform that is an aws.
   [
   cloud trail: concered mainly with who did what did on aws
   cloud watch: concered mainly with whats happening with aws resource so u can respond to it.
   network L4: not aware of application and simply forward traffic from client to backend (ec2 server)
   application L7: aware of application and provide path based routing.
   ]

5) i Involved in build, deployment trouble shooting and environment issues.

6) i Worked on Terraform for Infrastructure automation on cloud AWS
   provider{access_key, secret_key}, resource{ami, instance_type=t3.xlarge}
   terraform apply --ver-file test.tfvars -var 'aws_access_key=' -var 'aws_secret_key=' (test server)
   
7) we use ansible for configuration management and application build setup.{ansible-playbook  playbook1.yml  -b, 
   ansible all -m command -a 'touch file1' (create file)}
   
   Playbook: name, host, tasks(modules) like yum, service, shell,

Docker : containers is a running instance of image.
         docker images are templates used to create docker containers.
         virtualization means run multiple os on a single machine or physical system.
         docker run -ti --rm ubuntu /bin/bash (create temporary container) it --> interactive mode, d  --> demon 
         systemctl start docker
         docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) (remove all containers)

Step 1) i will Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins. i'll Go to the Available section and find the plugin “Deploy to container Plugin” and install the plugin. 
                 and Restart the Jenkins server.
step 2) Deploy to container plugin takes a war/ear file and deploys that to a running remote application server at the end of a build.
step 3) then i'll go to created Build project and click the Configure option. Choose the option “Deploy war/ear to a container

- i have worked on java projects.
- we have the pipelines in jenkins those pipeline will deploy the war file into the tomcat.
- jenkins code will checkout into local machine.
- we have stages wise deployments.
- stage level, dev env level and deployment stage in the same pipeline.
- coming to production level deployment process in different pipeline.
 
- integration and delevary in one pipeline. 

- we maintain supparate pipeline for production.
- we have the plugins 
- 
- when binary file created those binaries are pushing into s3.
- we use ansible for few services like deployment and configuration perpose those playbooks will takecare of my seniour devops engineers.
